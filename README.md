Hermod
========

Hermod is an open-source initiative tracker for tabletop RPG's such as Dungeons & Dragons. It was born out of the frustration of having to get out a piece of paper and writing down the initiative of each player and non-player character individually, instead of having the players do that themselves.

Hermod ends all your worries of having to somehow order all the initiative rolls of an encounter on a piece of paper and keeping track of whos turn it is. Instead the players just roll their (and possibly their companions) initiative and add them to the tracker themselves, while you can roll iniative for all of the enemy units.

Usage
-----

If you want to build the program for yourself, you will first need to install the [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started). You can then simply clone and run this project.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/TheGalidor/hermod.git
$ cd hermod
$ cargo run # if you only want to run the program
```
